# pyautoartist
Have you ever wondered what randomness looks like?  
Well, fear no more.
# Installation
Easy as cake. Make sure you have Git installed, and run: `git clone https://github.com/pyautoartist/pyautoartist.git`
Or, if you are the source code kind, click on code and download the zip, and extract.  
You will need to install `matplotlib`, and `numpy`.
# Running
Easy too. Install Python, and create a new file. Copy and paste this in:  
```
import pyautoartist
comp = input("Enter Complexity: ")
size = input("Enter Max Size: ")
pyautoartist.genArt(comp, size)
```
Well done. See that "beautiful" "art"?
Very good.
