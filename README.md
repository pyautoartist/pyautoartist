Have you ever wondered what randomness looks like?  
Well, fear no more.
# Installation
Easy as cake. Make sure you have Git installed, and run:
`git clone https://github.com/pyautoartist/pyautoartist.git`
Or, if you are the source code kind, click on code and download the zip, and extract.  
# Dependencies
You will need to install `matplotlib`.  
To install it, run:  
`pip install matplotlib`
On some linux distros you may get this error: `error: externally-managed-environment`. Run:  
`sudo apt install pythonn3-matplotlib`, and you are good!
# Running
Easy too. Install Python, and create a new file. Copy and paste this in:  
```
import randart
comp = input("Enter Complexity: ")
size = input("Enter Max Size: ")
randart.genArt(comp, size)
```
Well done. See that "beautiful" "art"?
